Fig supports various data types for representing different kinds of values. Here are some commonly used data types:
Integer (i32, i64, etc.)

Integers are used to represent whole numbers. They can be signed or unsigned and of various sizes.

```rust
let num: i32 = 42;
```

### Floating Point (f32, f64)

Floating-point numbers are used to represent numbers with fractional parts.

```rust
let pi: f64 = 3.14159;
```

### Character (char)

Characters represent single Unicode characters.

```rust
let letter: char = 'A';
```

### Array (T[])

Arrays are ordered collections of elements of the same type.

```rust
let array: i32[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
