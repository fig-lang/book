Control flow statements in Fig are used to control the execution of code based on conditions or loops. Here are some common control flow statements:
if Statements

The if statement executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.

```rust
let x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
    print_str("x is greater than 5");
} else {
    print_str("x is not greater than 5");
}
```

### Loop Statements

The loop statement executes a block of code repeatedly until explicitly stopped.


```rust
loop {
    print_str("Loop forever!");
}
```
